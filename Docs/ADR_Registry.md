# ADR (Architecture Decision Register)

An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that describes a choice the team makes about a significant aspect of the software architecture they're planning to build. Each ADR describes the architectural decision, its context, and its consequences. ADRs have states and therefore follow a lifecycle.

The following are Architecture Decisions that have made in the context of this solution:
-  [ADR01 - Common Software Application Design Principles and practice](../Docs/ADRs/ADR01.md)
-  [ADR02 - Cloud native](../Docs/ADRs/ADR02.md)
-  [ADR03 - Microservice architecture](../Docs/ADRs/ADR03.md)
-  [ADR04 - Event driven architecture](../Docs/ADRs/ADR04.md)
-  [ADR05 - Infrastructure as Code](../Docs/ADRs/ADR05.md)
-  [ADR06 - Microsoft Based Development Languages](../Docs/ADRs/ADR06.md)
-  [ADR07 - CosmosDB Database](../Docs/ADRs/ADR07.md)
-  [ADR08 - MSAL Based Security](../Docs/ADRs/ADR08.md)
