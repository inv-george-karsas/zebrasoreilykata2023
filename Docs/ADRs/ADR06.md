# ADR 06: Microsoft Based Development Languages

## Status

Accepted

## Context

* Object-oriented programming: C# is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows you to organize your code into objects, making it easier to write and maintain complex applications.
* Cross-platform support: C# is a cross-platform language, which means that you can write code for Windows, Linux, and macOS using the same language and tools.
* Performance: C# is a high-performance language, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and complex operations quickly and efficiently.
* Integration with .NET framework: C# is designed to work with the .NET framework, which provides a wide range of libraries and tools for building applications.
* Large developer community: C# has a large and active developer community, which means that there are plenty of resources, tools, and libraries available to help you build your application.
* Security: C# provides several security features, such as type safety, memory safety, and exception handling, which help prevent security vulnerabilities in your code.

Overall, C# is a powerful and versatile language that can be used to build a wide range of applications, from desktop and web applications to mobile apps and games.

## Decision

We will utilise C# as the primary language for developing our applications.

## Consequences

* We will need to ensure that our Engineers are sufficiently trained in C# to utilise the language effectively
* We will need to ensure that our Engineers utilise common development tooling to improve productivity
