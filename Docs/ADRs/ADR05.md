# ADR 05: Infrastructure as Code

## Status

Accepted

## Context
* Consistency: Infrastructure as code allows you to define your infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way, which can help avoid errors and ensure that your infrastructure is always configured correctly.
* Scalability: Infrastructure as code allows you to easily scale your infrastructure up or down as needed, without having to manually configure each instance.
* Version control: Infrastructure as code allows you to version control your infrastructure, which means that you can track changes over time and roll back to previous versions if needed.
* Collaboration: Infrastructure as code allows for easier collaboration between team members, as changes can be made and reviewed in a controlled and consistent manner.
* Automation: Infrastructure as code allows you to automate the process of provisioning and configuring infrastructure, which can save time and reduce errors.
* Portability: Infrastructure as code allows you to define your infrastructure in a way that is portable across different cloud providers or environments.


## Decision
We will utilise Infrastructure as Code in our solution to effectively provision infrastructure across our Azure environment.


## Consequences

* We will need to set standards for implementing Infrastructure as Code
* We will need to develop the skills to be able to utilise Infrastructure as Code
* We will need to implement policies on our Azure tenant to ensure standards are adhered to
