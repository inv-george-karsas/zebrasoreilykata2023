# NFR (Non Functional Requirements)

Non-functional requirements or NFRs are a set of specifications that describe the systemâ€™s operation capabilities and constraints and attempt to improve its functionality. These are basically the requirements that outline how well it will operate including things like speed, security, reliability, data integrity, etc.

The following is a list of NFRs that are relevant to this solution:
-  [NFR01 - Performance](../Docs/NFRs/NFR01.md)
-  [NFR02 - Scalability](../Docs/NFRs/NFR02.md)
-  [NFR03 - Availability](../Docs/NFRs/NFR03.md)
-  [NFR04 - Security](../Docs/NFRs/NFR04.md)
-  [NFR05 - Reliability](../Docs/NFRs/NFR05.md)
-  [NFR06 - Maintainability](../Docs/NFRs/NFR06.md)
