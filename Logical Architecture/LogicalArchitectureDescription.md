## Logical Architecture 
A logical solution architecture is a more detailed and refined view of a conceptual solution architecture. It provides a more specific and detailed design of the system or application, including the logical components, their interactions, and how they fit together to achieve the desired functionality.


A logical solution architecture typically includes the following elements:

* **System components**: The system components define the specific modules, services, and applications that make up the system or application.
* **Data architecture**: The data architecture defines the specific data structures, data flows, and data storage mechanisms that will be used to support the system or application.
* **Integration architecture**: The integration architecture defines the specific integration patterns and mechanisms that will be used to connect the system or application to other systems and applications.
* **Security architecture**: The security architecture defines the specific security mechanisms and protocols that will be used to protect the system or application from unauthorized access and attacks.
* **Deployment architecture**: The deployment architecture defines the specific deployment patterns and mechanisms that will be used to deploy the system or application to different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Overall, a logical solution architecture provides a more detailed and refined view of how a system or application will be built, and helps to ensure that the design meets the business
 and technical requirements. It provides a roadmap for the development process, and helps to ensure that the system or application is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
